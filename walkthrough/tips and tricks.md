# Tips and tricks!

There may be some questions you have that aren't covered in the walkthrough itself. Hopefully we answer them here, but if not, check out the [FAQ](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/)! 

## How do I get more bells?
1. Play the stalk market: buy turnips at a low price and sell them high (see https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-life/turnips/).
2. Dive and catch sea creatures to sell back to Nook's Cranny.
3. Grow stuff (fruits, flowers, pumpkins, etc) and sell to Nook's Cranny.
4. If you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, trade with other players for various items.
5. Save spare critters to sell to Flick and CJ, who buy their respective critters for 1.5x more than Nook's Cranny purchases them for.
6. Sell spare assessed fossils to Nook's Cranny.

## How do I get more Nook Miles/Nook Miles Tickets?
Unfortunately the only true way to get more Nook Miles is to do the Nook Miles and Nook Miles+ achievements. The other alternative, if all you want are NMT, is to trade with other players. 

## How do I get more iron nuggets/stone/clay/gold nuggets?
- Visit Nook Miles Ticket islands (mystery tours). These islands always have rocks you can hit for materials, and have a higher chance of dropping **iron nuggets**. This is especially helpful when you are building Nook's Cranny.
- Wait for the rocks' respawn (everyday at 5 am) and extract the most materials from each rock by following this guide: https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-life/#how-can-i-get-8-hits-from-a-rock
- Trade with other players if you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

## Can I speed up crafting?
You can! Tap <span class="icon-A"></span> **twice** to speed up crafting.

## How do I accelerate dialogue speed?
Hold <span class="icon-B"></span>, <span class="icon-L"></span> or <span class="icon-R"></span> to speed up dialogue.

## I can't find [Wisp's](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/visiting/#wisp) spirit pieces!
Having trouble finding Wisp's spirit pieces? Let your character chill out in one spot for a bit -- his spirit pieces should eventually move toward you!

## How can I tell if I donated X critter to the museum?
Open up your **Critterpedia**, then find the critter in question. If you have donated it to the museum, it will have a "DONATED" stamp with a little owl symbol next to it.

## How do I tell if the critter I just caught is the first one?
If your character says "Yes!" after they've caught a critter successfully, that means it is the first time you have ever caught that critter.
