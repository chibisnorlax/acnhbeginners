# Day 3
Welcome to day 3 of the game! You should have completed the following:

- Obtained the Flimsy Shovel and Vaulting Pole DIY recipes
- Donated 15 unique artifacts. (The museum should be under construction today!) 
- Activated quest for Nooks Cranny
- Gone on a mystery island tour

If you haven't, please see [Day 2](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/walkthrough/day%202/) for further guidance.

# Tasks
## Nooks Cranny completion
- Finish gathering resources for Nook's Cranny. As a reminder, you must collect:
  - 30 **Wood**
  - 30 **Softwood**
  - 30 **Hardwood**
  - 30 **Iron Nuggets**
- Upon completion, Timmy will hand you the Nook's Cranny shop placement kit. Find a suitable location to place it down, as you will not be able to move it for some time.

{: .note}
**Don't stress** if you haven't actually finished this by today! We **highly recommend** you play the game at your own pace. This guide is paced to get you through the tutorial as fast as possible, but this is *not* how everyone wants to play, and we want you to play to your enjoyment. 

### Tips for collecting materials
- If you’ve collected all the materials from your island but still need more, you could go to a mystery island by redeeming a Nook Miles Ticket (NMT) from the Nook Stop and going to the airport. On mystery islands, you will find rocks, trees, flowers, and shells, making them a great way to get more resources. For more information about mystery islands, see [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-life/#what-are-the-different-mystery-islands-and-what-can-i-find-on-them).
- Your island has 6 rocks that should be accessible with your newly-obtained vaulting pole. Make sure you're getting the max amount of hits from your rocks each day you play! See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-life/#how-can-i-get-8-hits-from-a-rock) for more info.

## What else can I do today?
- Unfortunately, today is not terribly eventful in terms of game progression. We recommend you harvest resources, talk with your villagers, perhaps catch some critters or dig up some fossils to give to Blathers once the museum opens up.
