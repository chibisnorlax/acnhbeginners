# Days 5-7
Welcome to Days 5-7! The following days will be clumped together as there is much less structure and these objectives can be completed any time before the end of the week. Before proceeding, please make sure you've completed the following objectives:
- Crafted and placed your first bridge
- Placed and furnished three plots

If you have not completed any of this please see [Day 4](/acnhbeginners/day-4/) for further guidance.

# Tasks
## Customization workshop
- Now that you've furnished the plots, Tom Nook should make an announcement about his **customization workshop**. Customization allows you to change the look of some items.
  - *Note:* Not every item is customizable.
- Customization is relatively straightforward, all you need to do is bring the **item you want to customize** and the required number of <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/RemakeKit.png" id="inv-icon"></span> **customization kits** to a workbench and select `Customize Something`.
- Tom Nook will give you <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/RemakeKit.png" id="inv-icon"></span> **50 customization kits** for you to use and experiment with.

## Harvey and his island
- In the next couple days you might see a hippie dog <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/spn.png" id="inv-icon"></span> walking around your island. Talking to him will prompt him to introduce himself as Harvey (Harv for short) and invite you to visit his island.
- Harv's island is also home to his photo studio, called **Photopia**, and you can use that building to stage photos for fun.

{: .note}
Harv's island is also where you obtain **villager and special character posters**. You can do this by spawning your villagers into Photopia (select the tab with the cat head on it when in design mode), or by scanning in a villager/special character's [Amiibo](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/villagers/#what-are-amiibos-who-has-an-amiibo). Even if the game complains said character can't come to Photopia, this still unlocks the corresponding poster.

## Able Sisters
- You may notice with the opening of Nook's Cranny that Mabel <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/hgh.png" id="inv-icon"></span> now visits every so often.
- To get Mabel to propose opening the Able Sisters shop on your island, buy **at least one item** from her each time she visits, over a total of 3 visits. The third time you purchase, she will ask you about opening up shop on your island.
- For more info on Mable, visit [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/#mabel). <!-- does this link ACTUALLY tell you more info? no. but it looks fancy, so. -->

## Upgraded Resident Services and Isabelle
- When all 3 of your brand new villagers have moved in, Tom Nook will make an announcement that he is upgrading the Resident Services tent into a building -- hooray! 
- There's nothing you have to do to proceed with this, but the building will be down and inaccessible for a day. If you have an ABD streak, it will not be affected by the construction day, so don't worry about losing your miles.

### Isabelle
- Isabelle <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/sza.png" id="inv-icon"></span> is an NPC you meet once the upgrade of the Resident Services is complete. Tom Nook will introduce her during announcements and explain that she will take some of his responsibilities.
- Isabelle also adds some new options for you. Visit [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/#isabelle) to learn more about Isabelle and what she does. 

### Construction counter 
- You now have access to Tom Nook's **Construction Counter**. By sitting in front of Tom Nook's desk, you may now:
  - Ask to build inclines
  - Ask to build ramps
  - Ask to move buildings (everything except the Resident Services building and airport can be moved)

* * *
<!-- tentative organization for now. -->
# Project K
- The activation of this quest signals the tail end of the tutorial. Once you have finished this quest, the tutorial will be over and you will not have any more quests given by Tom Nook to complete.
- Speak to Tom Nook at the construction counter and ask him "What should I do?". He will explain that he has a vision for the island, and that he would like to invite [K.K. Slider](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/#kk-slider) <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/NpcIcon/tkkA.png" id="inv-icon"></span> to perform on your humble island.
- Project K is split into three phases, all of which need to be completed in order for K.K. Slider to visit:
  1. Build a Campsite
  2. Invite more villagers to live on your island
  3. Improve your island's image
- How to complete these steps will be outlined below.

### Campsite
- The first thing Tom Nook will want you to do is build a campsite. He will give you the DIY for a **Campsite construction kit**, a temporary DIY that you must craft in order to place the campsite. The recipe calls for:
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>15 <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/DIYWoodNormal.png" id="inv-icon"></span> <b>Wood</b></li>
    <li>15 <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/DIYWoodSoft.png" id="inv-icon"></span> <b>Softwood</b></li>
    <li>15 <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/DIYWoodHard.png" id="inv-icon"></span> <b>Hardwood</b></li>
    <li>15 <span><img src="https://alexislours.github.io/img/MenuIcon/OreIron.png" id="inv-icon"></span> <b>Iron Nuggets</b><br></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
- Once crafted you may place the campsite wherever you see fit. You can move it later if you decide later on that you don't like it's placement.
- In 2 days, your campsite will have it's first visitor! This visitor will be a [**smug** villager](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/villagers/#what-are-the-villager-personalities) and they are *required* to be invited in order to progress the story.
  - If you don't like your camper, you can always let them move out later on.

### More Villagers
- With your first campsite visitor settled in, the next step in Project K is to obtain **2 more villagers** to move in to your island.
- There are many ways to find new villagers, but in all cases you'll first need an **empty plot**. You can get one from Tom Nook by selecting the "Let's talk infrastructure" option, then selecting the "Sell some land".
- Each plot of land costs **10,000 bells**, and you will receive a housing kit to place somewhere on your island.
- Once such a plot is ready on your island, your possibilities for inviting a villager are as following:

**Option 1: Find a villager on mystery island** 
- Purchase a Nook Miles Ticket, then speak with Orville in the airport and ask to go on a Mystery Tour.
- As long as you have an open plot, a villager will be present on the mystery island you visit.
- To invite a villager to move in, speak with them until the prompt to invite them appears. When you return back to your island, the empty plot will now say "SOLD" with the villager's name on it. If you do not wish to invite the villager, you can simply ignore them and leave.
- You can visit as many mystery islands as you wish to until you find a villager you like.

{: .caution}
Once you invite a villager from a mystery island, **no more will appear for the day**, even if you have an empty plot for them.

**Option 2: Invite another campsite visitor**
- Occasionally, someone new will visit the campsite. Don't worry, Isabelle will be sure to inform you if someone is visiting on any given day.
- If you want that villager to live on your island, you can talk to them until they accept to move in. They might ask you to play a little game before accepting, but even if you lose, you'll never be locked out of that villager and you can keep talking to them until they give you another chance.
- Similarly, you can summon a villager to the campsite by scanning their Amiibo at the NookStop. For them to accept to move in, you'll have to invite them on three different days and give them a DIY item they request each visit. If you don't know the DIY for the item they are requesting, they'll give you a recipe card for it.

{: .note}
Campers, both random or summoned with an Amiibo, have an exception to the empty plot needed rule. If you already have 10 housing plots, and all 10 are already occupied or at least claimed, the camper can replace a villager currently living on your island. Random campers choose someone random, but campers summoned with an Amiibo give you the choice of who to replace. If you have **less than 10 villagers**, you will still need an empty plot, they will not offer to swap with a current resident.

**Option 3: Invite a villager leaving from another island**
- If a villager is about to move out from another player's island (players say these villagers are "in boxes", meaning they'll be cleaning their house and packing their belongings in cardboard boxes), you can visit said island and talk to that villager to invite them to yours.
- Note that this option **will not work** if you have 5 or less villagers. 

**Option 4: Let Tom Nook handle it!**
- If you leave an empty plot unclaimed, Tom Nook will sell it to a random villager.

### Island Rating
- The final step in Tom Nook's Project K is to improve the island's image.
- You can check your island's rating by speaking with Isabelle. The goal is to achieve a **3-star rating**.
  - Isabelle is also a good resource if you're having trouble with achieving a 3-star rating, as she will give specific feedback about what the island lacks.
- For a complete breakdown of the island rating system, visit [the FAQ](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-dev/rating/).
