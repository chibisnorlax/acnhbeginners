# Where do I go from here?
- in the editing process :)

## Museum upgrade!
The last and final upgrade to the museum installs an art section! To unlock the Museum upgrade you need to have donated **60 critters/fossils** to [Blathers](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/permanent/#blathers) ! That means 20 from the previous stages to build the museum (See previous days in the tutorial starting [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/day-2/#day-2)) plus 40 more!

After this Blathers will tell you about upgrading the museum
- how long it'll take
- how much art (?)
- around when redd with be availble(?)
  - This is only unlocked once you have met and bought an artwork from Redd! See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/visiting/#redd) for more information on Redd!
