# Where do I go from here?

{: .note}
Before reading this section, please make sure you have completed the entire tutorial. To navigate to various sections of the walkthrough, see below.

### Tutorial
- [Day 1](/acnhbeginners/day-1/)
- [Day 2](/acnhbeginners/day-2/)
- [Day 3](/acnhbeginners/day-3/)
- [Day 4](/acnhbeginners/day-4/)
- [Day 5-7](/acnhbeginners/day-5-7/)

You may be wondering to yourself: What do I do now? Where do I go from here? This may be especially true if this is your first Animal Crossing game. AC:NH is a **sandbox game**, which means that beyond the tutorial, the direction of the game is almost entirely up to you. Unfortunately, this can feel overwhelming for some players. Not to worry -- if you find yourself at a loss of direction, are confused, or are simply bored and would like some goals to work toward, this section may help you.

## Upgrade Nook's Cranny
Much like past games, you can upgrade Nook's Cranny to it's larger, more polished version. In order to do this, you must meet the following requirements:
1. Made at least **200k bells** in total transactions (this includes both buying and selling). 
2. Mabel must visit at least **once**.
3. Nook's Cranny must be open for at least **30 days**. 

Once all 3 requirements have been met, the Nooklings will inform you of the shop upgrade.

### What's the difference?
An upgraded Nook's Cranny unlocks the following:
- A third slot for houseware/wall-mounted items.
- Seasonal items are now sold, and appear in the lower left corner of the shop.
- The cabinet is now to the right upon entry.

## Upgrade the Museum (Art Wing)
The last and final upgrade to the museum installs an **art section**. To unlock the museum upgrade you'll need to donate a total of **60 critters/fossils** to [Blathers](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/permanent/#blathers). Since you have already donated 20 artifacts in the process of unlocking the museum, you'll need to donate 40 more for a grand total of 60.

See previous days in the tutorial starting [here](/acnhbeginners/day-2/) for further guidance.

### How do I obtain art?
The next free day after Blathers talks about the art expansion, [Redd](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/visiting/#redd) the fox will pay you a visit. You can purchase art to donate to the museum from Redd. The first time he visits, he will be wandering around your island. Each subsequent time, you'll be able to board his boat to peruse his selection of art.

### When will I see Redd again?
See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/visiting/#how-often-does-x-visit-how-do-i-unlock-x-character) for the NPC schedule.

<!-- Potentially move to FAQ instead of putting this here
### My villager gifted me art, is it real?
- You can check if it real!
  - Smug villagers will always gift **fake** scultputures or art peices.
  - Jocks and Lazy villagers can send any type of art peice or sculputure and it can be **real** or **fake**.
  - Cranky villagers will only send **real** or **fake sculputures**.
- Normal, Peppy, Snooty and Uchi (Sistely) personality villagers will **not** gift any type of art! This means all **female** villagers! -->

<!-- {: .note}
The Wild painting is classified as a Sculpture at the moment which means that you can also be gifted this by Cranky villagers! -->


<!-- ### **More art information**
- How many art pieces/sculptures/statues are there?
  - There are 30 art pieces and 13 statues/sculptures!
- Redd's art for sale:
  - Redd will always have 4 pieces of art per visit!
  - You have a 10% chance of having **all the art** that Redd sells in a trip to be **fake**
  - You have a 50% chance to have **1 real piece** of art amongst the 4 Redd is selling in one trip.
  - You have a 30% chance to have **2 real pieces** of art amongst the 4 Redd is selling in one trip.
  - You have a 10% chance to have **3 out of the 4 pieces of art to be real** in one trip. -->

## Upgrade your house
You can now upgrade your house to have more rooms and storage spaces! Additionally, you can unlock various exterior customizations. You can obtain these upgrades once you have paid the previous loan, then talk to **Tom Nook** using the option "About my home". The upgrades can be found [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/unlocks/#house-unlocks).

{: .note} 
You can't continue to the next upgrade **until** you have paid off the upgrade you just got. i.e. If you just bought the back room addition, you'll need to pay the 348,000 bell loan off completely in order to get the left room addition. Also note that you do not need to continue to the next upgrade if you do not want to.
