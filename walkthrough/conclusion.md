# Where do I go from here?
Before reading this please make sure you have completed the tutorial of the game until the point where you have all the buildings! (See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/day-1/#day-1) for the beginning of the tutorial for more guidance!) Now what do you do after completing the tutorial? See below for more things to do!

## Museum upgrade!
The last and final upgrade to the museum installs an art section! To unlock the Museum upgrade you need to have donated **60 critters/fossils** to [Blathers](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/permanent/#blathers) ! That means 20 from the previous stages to build the museum (See previous days in the tutorial starting [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/day-2/#day-2)) plus 40 more!


After this Blathers will tell you about upgrading the museum to include an art section!

### **How do I obtain art?**
- You need to buy art from Redd! See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/visiting/#redd) for more information on Redd
- At first you will find him wondering around your island. His ship will be docked at the secret beach at the back of your island
- Talk to Redd and he will try and sell you an art piece for 40k bells! He will later drop his price to 4k bells.
  - You can now take this piece of art to Blathers and donate it to the new section in the museum!
  
  
  
### **When will I see Redd again?**
- See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/visiting/#how-often-does-x-visit-how-do-i-unlock-x-character) for the npc schedule!


### **Fake art VS real art?**
- See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-pAxNEnqKlpH7YJuUeKVjxVAvsoujQYjQcmQ8q5VCU/edit?usp=sharing) for help on which art is real and which is fake!


### **What do I do with fake art?**
- Gift to your villagers
- Use as decoration


You can do whatever you want with fake art! You are unble to donate it to Blathers though!


### My villager gifted me art, is it real?
- You can check if it real!
- The chance of real art from villagers
- The chance of fake art from villagers


### **More art information**
- How many art pieces/sculptures/statues are there?
  - There are 30 art pieces and 13 statues/sculptures!
- Redd's art for sale:
  - Redd will always have 4 pieces of art per visit!
  - You have a 10% chance of having **all the art** that Redd sells in a trip to be **fake**
  - You have a 50% chance to have **1 real piece** of art amongst the 4 Redd is selling in one trip.
  - You have a 30% chance to have **2 real pieces** of art amongst the 4 Redd is selling in one trip.
