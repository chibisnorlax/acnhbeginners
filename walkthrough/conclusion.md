See below for more things to do!

## Museum upgrade!
The last and final upgrade to the museum installs an art section! To unlock the Museum upgrade you need to have donated **60 critters/fossils** to [Blathers](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/permanent/#blathers) ! That means 20 from the previous stages to build the museum (See previous days in the tutorial starting [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/day-2/#day-2)) plus 40 more!


After this Blathers will tell you about upgrading the museum to include an art section!

### **How do I obtain art?**
- You need to buy art from Redd! See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/visiting/#redd) for more information on Redd
- At first you will find him wondering around your island. His ship will be docked at the secret beach at the back of your island
- Talk to Redd and he will try and sell you an art piece for 40k bells! He will later drop his price to 4k bells.
  - You can now take this piece of art to Blathers and donate it to the new section in the museum!
  
  
### **When will I see Redd again?**
- See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/visiting/#how-often-does-x-visit-how-do-i-unlock-x-character) for the npc schedule!

### **What do I do with fake art?**
