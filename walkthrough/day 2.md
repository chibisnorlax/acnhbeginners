# Day 2

Welcome to day 2 of the game! By now, your player has woken up from their sleep, and the game is now synced to **real-time**. You should have:
- Placed your tent and your villagers' tents.
- Paid off your first loan.
- Learned how to craft DIY items.
- Given 5 critters to Tom Nook and placed Blathers' tent.

If you haven't, please visit [Day 1](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/walkthrough/day%201) for further guidance.

Additionally, the **airport** is now open.

# Tasks

## Visit Blathers
- Blathers should have set up his tent in the location that you placed it. Go pay him a visit!
- Upon first speaking with him, he should give you the **Flimsy Shovel** and **Vaulting Pole** DIY recipes. The former can be used to get materials from rocks, dig holes, and uproot tree stumps. The latter can be used to travel across rivers.
- He will then ask you to donate **15 unique bugs, fish, and/or fossils** to him. You will need to complete this in order for Blathers to upgrade his tent to the full museum building. 
- **Fossils** can be found by digging up spots in the ground that look like X's. Bring them to Blathers to be assessed. 

## Build Nook's Cranny 
- Head to Resident Services and speak with Timmy. As long as your tent was **upgraded into a house**, he should speak with you about building Nook's Cranny.
- Timmy will ask you to gather the following materials:
  - 30 **Wood**
  - 30 **Softwood**
  - 30 **Hardwood**
  - 30 **Iron Nuggets**
- To obtain all types of wood, hit trees with your axe. To obtain iron nuggets, hit the large rocks you see around your island.
- Of these, the iron nuggets will be the most difficult to obtain. We recommend reading [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-life/#how-can-i-get-8-hits-from-a-rock) to see how to get the most material drops out of your rocks.
- Timmy will not take materials from you unless you have the full 30 he is asking for, so don't worry about coming back to talk to him until you've collected 30 of a material.
- This quest does not have to be completed in one day. In fact, it may take you awhile to gather all the materials you need. But if you want more, you're in luck, Tom Nook is going to give you a free **Nook Miles Ticket**, which will allow you to visit a mystery island and gather more materials. 

## Complete your first Mystery Tour
- Upon talking to Tom Nook, he should mention something called a Nook Miles Ticket (often abbreviated as NMT), and give you one for free. 
- Take this to the **airport** and speak with [Orville](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/#orville-and-wilbur), the dodo bird at the desk. Orville will explain to you what mystery tours are, and offer to take you on one in exchange for one NMT.
- The mystery islands are fantastic for resource gathering and critter-catching. Additionally, the island may also have a villager who you can talk to and invite to live with you. For more info on mystery islands, visit [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-life/#what-are-the-different-mystery-islands-and-what-can-i-find-on-them). 

## What else can I do today?
- Since you unlocked the Nook Stop today, it may be a good idea to purchase the **tool ring**, which lets you quickly access your tools by using the D-Pad on your Switch.
- Additionally, you may want to purchase the "Pretty Good Tools" recipe pack from the Nook Stop, which will give you DIY recipes for more durable versions of the axe, shovel, fishing rod, net, and watering can.
- There might be a villager on the NMT island you visit. If you would like to invite them to live on your island, speak to them and ask them to move in.
